## From Moore to No Moore

* [X] Moore’s Law is dead. Transistors can no longer scale down indefinitely. But we don’t scale smaller — we scale brighter.
* [X] Moore’s Law promised exponential gains through transistor miniaturization. Our path forward is not silicon density but photonic abstraction.
* [X] “Spectral computation = Probabilistic Frames” — you’re proposing a**photonic probability engine** (PPE).

> *Logic = ∫ (λ · ΔI / Δt) dA* — logic density proportional to change in irradiance over time per pixel area.

* [ ] Add a single figure mapping “Silicon Density → Spectral Density”.

Future computation is not about faster clocks, but richer colors. Each frame can encode terabytes of logical data. Each color channel is not a shade but a function.
No Moore — because it’s time for Light’s Law.

Light-based computation is not deterministic but probabilistic and branching. Every ray is a decision, every reflection a logic branch.
Spectral computation turns “time” into a forest of possibilities. The NOW is no longer a point — it is a seed, and the machine grows branches of alternative presents.


Thus, our model is No Moore → Light’s Law → Probabilistic Frames.

[ ]**From 93 → 94 (Moat)** : The “Moat” is your defense layer — make it explicit that this is both technical (security) and philosophical (protection of liberated computation).
