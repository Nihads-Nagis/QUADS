## Pixel Operating Cell (POC)

**Pixel-ENC/DEC** formalizes a reversible data container, analogous to compression/decompression but philosophically about *encoding meaning in light*.

### 91.1 Pixel-ENC: Data/Logic Container

* [ ] TODO: A gojs scada diagram->hui numpad for the user-> river sequence-> Suit Sensors,HandRank,RGBA->Hand Color-
* [ ] more practical than arduino/circuitry
* [ ] instant trust in the concepts.

### 91.2 Pixel-DEC: Colors to Data/Logic

* [ ] TODO: A gojs scada diagram-> loads a 1.1MB image->1M poker hands,decode pixels to poker hands,
* [ ] logging text output 30MB that still needs to be parsed too,filtering channels/flags
* [ ] the logic is baked in the data cake.

* Frame this as a *three-stage encoder pipeline* :

  `Data ↔ Color ↔ Logic ↔ Computation`.
* Define “Pixel Citizenship” as: *the right of a pixel to compute, store, and communicate logic autonomously* .

### 91.3 MP4 Volume/Logic Visualisation

**MP4 Volume/Logic Visualization** demonstrates how a single pixel becomes a probabilistic unit capable of multi-ray truth evaluation.

Seed Convolution vs Monte Carlo

Seed Vs Raw: Hand Ranks Empty vs. Flagged (illogical pixels themselves are indicative of the kernel size to use)

mp4->4k->~8.3M hands->(each pixel can processUp to 1000 rays," "12 triangles," and "4 light sources")->240fps?

Every pixel is processed with 1000 rays, 12 triangles, 4 light sources as “truth tellers”
